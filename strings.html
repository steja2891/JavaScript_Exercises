		<h4>Introduction to HTML</h4>
		<p id="p1">HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
		HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
		HTML describes the structure of a Web page
		HTML consists of a series of elements
		HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
		HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

		HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images for your Internet browser. Without HTML, a browser would not know how to display text as elements or load images or other elements. HTML also provides a basic structure of the page, upon which Cascading Style Sheets are overlaid to change its appearance. One could think of HTML as the bones (structure) of a web page, and CSS as its skin (appearance).</p>
